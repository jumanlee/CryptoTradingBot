# Introduction
My completed project for a Crypto Trading Bot, which can make decisions on its own whether to buy or sell a set of cryptocurrencies. A sample data is included in the repo, which allows users to test and see that the bot is able to make a profit (explained in my pdf report in the repo). All the code is stored in the project folder. The folder also includes 20200317.csv, which is a sample dataset that you can use to test the bot.
