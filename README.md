# Introduction
My completed project for a Crypto Trading Bot, which can make decisions on its own whether to buy or sell a set of cryptocurrencies. Essentially the bot takes the place of the human, interacting with the crypto exchange to do the things automatically using the options on the menu.

# Code
All the code is stored in the OOP Midterm Project(final) folder. The folder also includes 20200317.csv, which is a sample dataset that you can use to test the bot.

# Software requirements
